    "To understand how banks operate--and how monetary policy works--we will discuss the basic mechanics of bank balance sheets.  We will use T-accounts to discuss how common banking transactions are reflected on the balance sheet.  We build a hypothetical bank from scratch observe how basic banking transactions affect its financial position.  We then aggregate across banks to show the balance sheet for the entire banking sector.  Finally, we discuss the balance sheet of the central bank and how it relates to private banks and creation of liquidity for the entire economy.\n",

    "- Reserves: Cash in the vault or deposits held at the Central Bank (e.g., the Federal Reserve in the U.S.). This is the most liquid asset.\n",
    "- Loans: Funds extended to households and businesses. These are the bank's most profitable assets, but also carry the highest risk.\n",

    "Liabilities are what the bank owes to others. They represent the bank's main sources of funds:\n",
    "- Deposits: Funds provided by customers (e.g., checking, savings, time deposits). These are a liability because the bank owes this money back to the depositor.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bank's make profits by transforming short-term liabilities (deposits) into longer-term assets (loans and securities).  Sometimes it is said that banks are in the business of \"borrowing short and lending long\" which means that there is always a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities on its balance sheet.  As such, banks must hold enough reserves for two reasons: (1) there may be an unexpected deposit outflow requiring reserves or (2) there exist reserve requirements imposed by the central bank.  Reserve requirements stipulate the fraction of deposits that must be held as reserves.  A reserve ratio of 100\\%, for example, would preclude the bank from issuing loans in excess of bank capital (owner's equity).  Conversely, a reserve ratio of 0\\% allows the bank to have zero reserves on hand.  In practice, a bank would never do this because they still optimally hold reserves as insurance against deposit outflow risk.  A bank that is unable to pay out its depositors would surely fail.  Any reserve ratio $rr < 1$ allows the bank to create inside money when they issue new loans.  Such a system is called **fractional reserve banking**.  Reserve requirements are often used as a regulatory measure to guarantee that the banking sector has enough liquid assets to satisfy its liabilities, instill trust in the banking sector, and insure against liquidity shocks.  The quantity of reserves required to be held by law is called **required reserves** and additional reserves the bank voluntarily holds are called **excess reserves**.\n",

    "Now the bank is required to hold $ \\$600,000$ in reserves, but only has $ \\$500,000$!  This illustrates the importance of holding reserves as insurance against deposit outflow risk: if bank has ample excess reserves, a deposit outflow does not necessitate changes in other parts of its balance sheet.  The department within a bank which is responsible for managing an appropriate level of reserves is called **liquidity management**.\n",

Similarly, selling off loans at a fraction of their value or calling in loans early is bad for business.  Borrowing from central bank lending facilities is a viable option, but often their is a stigma associated with doing so--it signals the market that the balance sheet of the bank is in bad shape.  The lowest cost source of reserves is the **interbank market**.  The interbank market is a decentralized exchange where financial institutions, primarily commercial banks, borrow and lend unsecured reserves to one another.  These interbank loans are often very short term (overnight), occur at the **interbank rate**, and facilitate liquidity transfers between banks.  In the US the interbank market is called the **Fed Funds market** and the interbank interest rate is called the **Fed Funds rate**\n",

These reserves are not free for FNB as they have to pay interest to SNB for the overnight loan.

    "In addition to liability risk from unanticipated deposit outflows, banks assets are also subject to risk as loans may default or the market value of securities may fall.  Bank capital acts has a financial cushion to absorb such unexpected losses.  Bank capital also affects the rate of return equity holders realize.  It also provides protection to depositors in the case of bank failure and is therefore an important source of public confidence in the banking system.  Maintaining adequate capital levels can help prevent a bank from taking on too much risk by limiting excessive asset growth.  International standards, such as the Basel II framework, provide regulators guidelines for bank capital requirements. \n",
