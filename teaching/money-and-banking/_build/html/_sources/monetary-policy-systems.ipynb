    "## The Market for Reserves\n",
    "\n",
    "On any given day some banks will have more reserves than they want, and some banks will have less reserves than they want. The **interbank money markets** are where banks borrow and lend reserves to each other using short-term financing arrangements. In the US the interbank money market is called the **Fed Funds Market** and the equilibrium interest rate that banks charge each other for reserves is called the **Fed Funds Rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks demand reserves for two reasons:\n",
    "1. Regulatory requirements: Many central banks require member commercial banks to hold a certain fraction of their liabilities in the form of reserves. This is called the **required reserve ratio**. In China it is usually around 12%.\n",
    "2. Payments: Banks need to hold reserves to settle payment requests that come through the payments network. Banks must hold the required reserve amount stipulated by law, but will also choose to hold some **excess reserves** as insurance against unanticipated payment requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central bank can manipulate overnight interest rates by intervening in the market for bank reserves. Different monetary policy tools have different affects on the market for reserves, and we will discuss each after providing a theoretical description of the market for reserves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's describe the demand function for bank reserves.  The quantity of reserves demanded by banks equals the sum of required reserves and excess reserves.  There is an opportunity cost of holding excess reserves: the interest rate that could be earned by lending them out (fed funds rate) less the interest earned on excess reserves ($i_{or}$).  When the Fed funds rate is high, it very costly to hold excess reserves because those reserves could have been lent out to earn a high rate of return.  When the Fed funds rate is low, it is not so costly for banks to hold excess reserves.  Therefore, there is a **negative relationship between the total demand for bank\n",
    "reserves and the overnight lending rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, let's describe the supply of bank reserves.  The central bank is a monopoly issuer of reserves.  The total supply of reserves equals the sum of nonborrowed reserves (supplied through open market operations) and borrowed reserves (supplied through the discount window). We will denote the cost of borrowing from the Fed is the discount rate $i_d$.  If $i_{ff} < i_d$ then banks will not borrow from the Fed and thus borrowed reserves will be zero. If, on the other hand, $i_{ff} > i_d$ then banks will want to keep borrowing from the fed and lending out the proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we have a vertical supply curve for reserves--representing the monopoly control of reserves in the banking system by the central bank--and a downward sloping demand curve for reserves.  This demand curve has a horizontal portion where the fed funds rate is equal to the discount rate--indicating the point at which there would be infinite borrowing from the Fed--and another horizontal protion at the interest on excess reserves rate--where the opportunity cost of holding reserves vanishes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before 2008, the Federal Reserve operated monetary policy under a \\textbf{corridor system}: there was an upper bound and lower bound on where short-term interest rates could go. The upper bound was the discount rate.  If short-term market rates were to rise about the upper bound, banks could borrow at the Fed and lend at the higher market interest rate.  Arbitrage would force these rates down to the borrowing rate at the Fed.  The lower bound was the interest on excess reserves (zero).  The lower bound is binding since banks would rather earn 0 percent holding reserves than a negative return from lending..\n",
    "\n",
    "In November 2008, the Fed raised interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate above short-term market interest rates and triggered a shift to a \\textbf{floor system}. A floor system removes the opportunity cost to banks of holding excess reserves by offering the banks a deposit rate at the Fed---the IOER rate---that is equal to or abvoe short-term market interest rates. If short-term rates fall below IOER rate, then banks could borrow at those lower rates and park the funds at the Fed.  Arbitrage, then, should cause short-term rates to converge to the IOER rate.  In theory, this allows the Fed to use it's balance sheet as a tool of monetary policy while still maintaining control over short-term interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under a floor system, monetary policy is not set by a market interest rate, but by an administrative interest rate: the IOER rate.  Monetary policy is not tied to the supply of reserves, but instead to the quantity of reserves demanded by banks which the central bank controls through changes to the IOER. The central bank sets the IOER rate higher enough that banks' demand for reserves becomes perfectly elastic with respect to inter-bank interest rates. Changes in the IOER rate, rather than open-market operations, is the main instrument of monetary policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the financial crisis the Federal Reserve did not pay interest on excess reserves (the foor on the Fed funds rate was at 0), but in October 2008 the Fed decided to pay a positive interest rate on excess reserves thereby raising the floor. In September 2013 the Fed began a program of taking in money from a wide range of non-bank financial institutions and paying interest. The technical name for this programme is the Overnight Reverse\n",
    "Repurchase Agreement Facility (ON RRP). Now the ON RRP rate is the effective floor.  The Fed says, \"*Any counterparty that can use the ON RRP facility should be unwilling to invest funds overnight with another\n",
    "counterparty at a rate below the ON RRP rate, just as any depository institution eligible to earn interest on reserves should be unwilling to invest funds overnight with another counterparty at a rate below the\n",
    "interest rate on excess reserves.*\"\n",

    "Why did the US central bank move to a floor system during the Financial crisis? According to Ben Bernanke, \"*...the risk that our emergency lending, which had the side effect of increasing bank reserves, would lead short-term interest rates to fall below our federal funds target and thereby cause us to lose control of monetary policy...Until this point we had been selling Treasury securities we owned to offset the effect of our [emergency] lending on reserves (the process called sterilization). But as our lending increased, that stopgap response would at some point no longer be possible because we would run out of Treasuries to sell.*\"\n",
