    "We have considered environments in which assets were perfect substitutes for fiat money and found that when fiat money offers a lower rate of return than other assets, it is not valued in equilibrium. We now explore how fiat money may nonetheless be valued because of its liquidity—its ability to facilitate consumption quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this, we will show why banks are valuable to the economy: they issue liquid liabilities and reconcile mismatches between the maturities of assets and the liquidity needs of agents. To do so, we modify our overlapping generations (OLG) framework to include the possibility of “early” and “late” consumption. This allows us to highlight how money provides liquidity services and how banks can replicate these services through the creation of inside money.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we introduce a three-period OLG environment to accommodate the notion of \"early\" versus \"late\" consumption where there exists a market for private debt.  Second, we show how liquidity constraints give rise to a role for fiat money.  Third, we combine both insights to study the coexistence of inside and outside money.  Lastly, we investigate how monetary policy interacts with the banking sector to affect the real economy.\n",

    "\n",
    "We begin once again  with the frictionless economy, now modified to incorporate \"early\" and \"late\" consumption.  Later we will introduce limited commitment so that fiat currency plays a role and yields a liquidity premium relative to other assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OLG economy now features *three-period-lived* agents, corresponding to the young, middle-aged, and old. Each agent is endowed with $y$ units of the consumption good when young but receives nothing thereafter. A production technology allows young agents to transform $k$ units of output into $f(k)$ when old--thus capital requires two periods to mature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Debt and Collateral\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents can borrow or lend in a market for private debt, denoted $a$, at interest rate $R$.  Debt is *collateralized* by capital,and we assume that capital is perfectly observable and fully seizable in the event of default.  Hence, lenders can verify borrowers’ holdings of capital and are willing to extend credit up to the collateral value.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each date $t$, the young decide how much to consume and how much to save.  Savings can take the form of either bonds ($a_t>0$), yielding a one-period rate of return $R$, or capital, giving a two-period return of $f(k)$.  The middle-aged generation consumes out of bond returns and may borrow ($a{t}<0$) from the current young,while the old generation consumes the output from their capital and repays prior debt.  Borrowing and lending therefore occur across generations, providing motives for borrowing and lending even with identical agents.  \n",

    "We now consider the opposite case of the previous model: suppose that the return to capital investment, $f(k)$ is *noncollateralizable*. In other words, the value of an individual’s capital cannot be verified or seized by others. This friction prevents the creation of private credit markets because borrowers could always default without consequence. As a result, the market for private debt collapses.\n",

    "Formally, agents now face the constraints $a_t,a_{t+1} \\geq 0$.  Since no debt would be repaid in equilibrium, there is no incentive to hold or issue private debt, and thus $a_t=a_{t+1}=0$. In such an environment, fiat money acquires a role: it becomes the only asset capable of transferring purchasing power across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup highlights two distinct motives for holding assets. Fiat money provides liquidity, allowing consumption in the near term, while capital offers a higher rate of return but only after two periods. This captures a realistic feature of modern economies: money is valued not because it yields the highest return, but because it facilitates timely exchange and consumption. Our goal is to build a model in which both fiat money and capital are valued in equilibrium—even though capital dominates money in terms of long-run return.\n",

    "## Banking in the OLG Economy\n",
    "\n",
    "We now enrich the model by introducing a special type of institution which can commit to honouring debt contracts: a bank. Because banks can commit to repay, they are able to issue a new form of liquid asset--**inside money**.  Inside money refers to money created by the private sector, such as demand deposits or bank credit, which is backed by private loans. This contrasts with outside money, like fiat currency, which is issued by the government. We will see that the coexistence of inside and outside money depends on profitability and credibility conditions for banks.\n",

The bank invests that single good into the creation of capital, which yields $X>n^2 after two periods. To honor its promise at $t+1$, the bank borrows from the next generation of young depositors, rolling over its liabilities one period at a time.   Depositors are willing to accept this contract if it offers at least as high a return as fiat currency, $n\\geq n/z$, where $z$ is the growth rate of the money supply.  Banks find the arrangement profitable since they earn $x>n^2$ on their investment.  Consequently, inside money replaces outside money: deposits dominate currency as the preferred liquid asset.\n",

Deposits are used by the banking sector to finance investment projects.  Although abstract, this description captures some salient features of modern economies.  Most highly liquid assets are not held in physical cash, but rather as deposits with some financial intermediary.  Most transactions occur by digitally debiting or crediting deposit accounts.  Banks value these deposits because they can be used to finance loans to businesses which are capital projects that yield some future rate of return.  Banks indeed have an asset maturity mismatch on their balance sheets where their liabilities (deposits) are short-term and their assets (loans/investments in capital) are long-term.\n",

    "In reality, the central bank does not fix $\\delta$ directly.  Instead, it chooses the interest rate on reserve loans (the **discount rate**), call it $\\psi$, and allows banks to decide how much to borrow.  We can therefore write the equilibrium deposit rate as,\n",

To obtain a well-defined solution, we can assume diminishing returns to capital: $f(k)$ where $f(0)=0, f'(0)=\\infty$, and $f''(k)<0$.  In this case, banks borrow reserves up to the point where the marginal return on capital equals the cost of borrowing:\n",

    "Since total interest-bearing assets are $k=\\Gamma^B+(1-\\gamma)H$, this condition determines equilibrium borrowing $\\Gamma^B$ and, in turn, $\\delta = \\Gamma^B/(\\Gamma^B+M)$.  Substituting these values gives the equilibrium interest rate and deposit holdings consistent with optimal behavior by both banks and households."
