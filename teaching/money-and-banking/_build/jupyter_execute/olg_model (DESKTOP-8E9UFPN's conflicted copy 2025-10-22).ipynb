    "### Wicksell's Triangle\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an economy with three people: A, B, and C (Ann, Bill, and Charlie); three time periods: 1, 2, 3 (morning, afternoon, night); and three time-dated goods: $c_1,c_2,c_3$.  Assume preferences and endowments such that everyone strictly prefers a good held by someone else:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "U_A &= \\beta c_3 + c_1 \\quad  \\text{and} \\quad (y_1,y_2,y_3)=(0,0,y) \\\\\n",
    "U_B &= \\beta c_1 + c_2 \\quad  \\text{and} \\quad (y_1,y_2,y_3)=(y,0,0) \\\\\n",
    "U_c &= \\beta c_2 + c_3 \\quad  \\text{and} \\quad (y_1,y_2,y_3)=(0,y,0) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta \\in (0,1) $ is discount factor.  For example, Ann most prefers morning bread $c_1$, but also enjoys her own evening bread $c_3$ albeit only a fraction $\\beta$ as much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although stylized, this structure highlights the trading frictions that give rise to some medium of exchange.  In particular, notice that there are no bilateral mutually beneficial trades.  That is, we cannot find any pair of agents where there is a double coincidence of wants.  If we pair Ann and Bill, for example, Ann wants the morning bread which Bill can produce, but Bill doesn't want the night bread that Ann produces.  Every pairwise combination yields the same problem. Without trade autarkic utility is $\\beta y$: each person only eats the bread they can produce.  If, however, bread could be allocated to those who most value it, then each agent could realize utility $y$.  This discrepancy between Pareto utility--that which is socially optimal--and autarkic utility demonstrates that there exist multilateral gains from trade.  Given lack of double coincidence of wants, the problem is this: What trading arrangement achieves Pareto utility $y$?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure proposes such a trading arrangement.  Charlie produces afternoon bread and gives it Bill.  Bill gives his morning bread to Ann.  And Ann gives her night bread to Charlie.  Everyone gets the good they most desire.  But notice that this trading arrangement is feasible only if Bill can *credibly promise* to engage in this multilateral exchange after receiving the afternoon bread from Charlie.  Is this a reasonable assumption?\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice from the preferences that Bill still enjoys his own morning bread, albeit less than Charlie's afternoon bread.  After receiving afternoon bread from Charlie, why should Bill not simply take it and also eat his own morning bread?  We could imagine that when Charlie and Bill meet, Bill says something like, \"Hey Charlie, you give me your afternoon bread now and I *promise* to deliver my morning bread to Ann, so you can get your night bread from her later.\"  But once Charlie hands over the bread to Bill, Bill may simply renege on his promise and enjoy his own bread too!  Charlie is no fool, he anticipates this and therefore refuses to trade with Bill in the first place thereby shutting down the entire multilateral trading arrangement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no feasible multilateral arrangement if agents cannot credibly keep their promises.  Or using economic language, if there is **lack of commitment**.  Besides an interesting theoretical conundrum, this problem strikes as being a very realistic friction in real world interactions.  Why should we believe someone's promise if there is there is only benefit and no cost of them reneging on said promise.  In this example, we have not mentions any punishment to Bill, or any outside enforcement of the aggreement struck by the three parties.  In there absence, Bill should never keep is promise and everyone understands that; thereby destroying any chance of a multilateral trading arrangement.  This small economy is doomed to autarky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical economic models implicitly assume that there exists **perfect commitment**: all agents make promises that are always kept.  One example of this assumption manifest are Arrow-Debreu securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting corollary to this example is this: Lack of double coincidence of wants is not sufficient to generate need for money.  Many textbooks motivate the need for currency by citing lack of double coincidence of wants.  The story is often told that once there exists lack of double coincidence of wants then currency arrives to save the day.  But this story is too simple.  Lack of double coincidence of wants is necessary but not sufficient.  There also must be lack of commitment.  After all, Wickell's triangle provides an example where there is lack of double coincidence of wants, but if agents can extend each other \"credit\" (a promise to deliver a future trade), then the Pareto optimal allocation can be achieved.  If we forced there to exist only multilateral gains from trade, then it is possible that Charlie would accept morning bread from Bill even though he doesn't want it, because it knows that he can trade morning bread with Ann for night bread later.  In this case, morning bread circulates a medium of exchange!  Charlie values it not because he wants to eat it, but because he expects to be able to use it to execute a trade later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the role that credit and liquid assets play in an economy, we must take seriously the reality of lack of commitment.  Our goal in developing the overlapping generations (OLG) model is to show how **fiat money** can improve economic allocations.  To give money a role to play, our model must acknowledge the trading frictions which prevent barter trades. We understand why fiat money is valuable if we understand the frictions it overcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we proceed as follows: First, we develop an OLG economy without frictions to identify what is Pareto optimal allocation in our environment.  Second, we introduce trading frictions which prevent the economy from obtaining a good allocation.  Third, we introduce fiat currency and show that it valuable because it facilitate good allocations.\n",

We say a person born in period $t$ is young in period $t$ and old in period $t+1$.  Agents die at the end of old age.  Additionally, there exist some *initial old* $N_0$ in period 1, who live for just one period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goods:** There is one nonstorable good; meaning that it perishes at the end of the period in which it was produced.  This good cannot be saved over time. Young agents work to produce $y$ units of the good, while the old cannot work.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice the fundamental problem that exists in this stylized environment: agents value consumption when old but are unable to produce any goods.  The only way that an old person can obtain consumption is if they trade with a young person who *can* produce goods.  But what can the old exchange with the young?  They have nothing.  Can the old *promise* to repay the young person later?  Certainly not: the old will be dead.  This economic environment delivers both lack of double coincidence of wants and lack of commitment.  Although highly stylized, it is a wonderful environment in which to explore the ramifications key frictions that give money a valuable role in the economy.\n",

Suppose that record keeping is too costly (e.g. young people can fake trading with old people to obtain goods when they are old).   A young person at time $t$ can only trade with young people of the same generation or old people of the previous generation.  Trading with the young is pointless, since there is no double coincidence of wants, and the old are not around the following period.  In this case, autarky is the only possible equilibrium without any other policy or institution.  The young consume their entire endowment when young and nothing when old.  Clearly a bad outcome.

Similarly, if fiat money has no value at time $T-1$ then no one is willing to hold it at time $T-2$.  By induction, we can see that fiat money will have no value in the present if there exists any finite date $T$ in the future where it certainly has no value.

    "Having identified the monetary equilibrium of our economy, we can now ask to what extent it is a \"good equilibrium.\"  That is, to what degree does it deliver maximum welfare to the citizens?  To measure this, we need only compare the allocation of the decentralized monetary economy to that of the central planner.  The central planner, after all, maximizes welfare by definition; thereby serving as a benchmark by which to judge the outcomes of decentralized equilibria.  We can simplify the problem even further.  Since the decentralized economy and the planner's problem share the same objective function---to maximize utility---we can guarantee the two solutions coincide if and only if the constraint of the optimization problems are the same.  Said plainly, does the feasibility line of the planner coincide with the budget line of the decentralized equilibrium?  If so, then the decentralized monetary economy achieves the Pareto optimal outcomes.  If not, then the planner could improve on the allocation.\n",

    "In our simple model thus far, we have shown how money is **essential**: it improves the allocation of the decentralized economy relative to its absence.  Now we want to investigate how the decentralized economy responds to changes in the supply of fiat money.  How are economic decisions altered?  Is there an optimal stock or growth rate of fiat money?  Can the government use fiat money to create revenue for itself?  How is inflation affected by changes in the supply of money?  Can money coexist with alternative assets?\n",

In reality two assets are almost never *perfect* substitutes as they differ in terms of the risk or liquidity.  However,  if two assets were indeed perfect substitutes, then both are held in a portfolio only if they provide the same rate of return.

    "### The Fisher Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to discuss how inflation and interest rates affect our real economy, it is useful to discuss the **Fisher equation**.  Named after economist Irving Fisher, this equation describes the relationship between nominal interest rates, real interest rates, and inflation.  All financial contracts are expressed in nominal terms--dollars, for example, in the US.  When a business want to borrow money from a bank, the loan contract specifies the interest payments in dollars.  However, we have already seen that the real value of those dollars can change over time when the money supply grows.  The Fisher equation corrects the nominal rate for inflation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $i_t$ denote gross nominal interest rate in period $t$ (in units of money), $r_t$ be gross real interest rate (in units of goods), and $p_t$ be the price of a good in fiat money.  The Fisher equation says,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line follows from $r_{t}\\pi_t$ is a very small value, so a useful approximation of the Fisher equation is that the nominal interest rate is equal to the real interest rate plus the inflation rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fisher equation can be understood as a no-arbitrage condition between nominal and real bonds.\n",

    "since the equilibrium inflation rate in our model is $\\pi_t=\\frac{\\nu_t}{\\nu_{t+1}}-1=\\frac{z}{n}-1$.  Often it is assumed that the real-interest rate is determined by forces outside the control of monetary policy.  This is an example of the classical dichotomy which posts that real variables (e.g. output, employment) and nominal variables (e.g. money supply, prices) are determined separately.  The real interest rate is thought to be determined by the level of technology and capital stock.  Consider a macro model like Solow where the equilibrium interest rate is equal to the marginal product of capital $r=f'(k)$.  The real rate of return on capital projects is independent of money supply or the price level.  If this assumption is true, then the Fisher equation implies that the nominal interest rate and inflation move one-for-one with each other.  That is, if the central bank increases the growth rate of the money supply inducing inflation, the nominal interest rate should rise by exactly the same magnitude as inflation.  \n",

    "The figure above shows that the nominal interest rate and inflation do not move one-for-one.  The different between the two--the real interest rate--varies substantially over time.  One popular explanation is that prices are sticky in the short-run.  This means that monetary policy does not immediately affect inflation, so changes in the nominal interest rate cause changes in the real interest rate.  Given enough time, inflation manifests in response to the policy and the real interest rate returns to its natural level.  There is a lot of evidence that this story carries water, but we do not yet have the tools in hand to incorporate nominal rigidities into our model.  Instead, we will work within the environment already described to posit an alternative explanation as to why nominal rates and inflation do not move one-for-one.\n",

    "We continue to suppose that output is produced from capital according to an increasing and concave function $f(k)$ and households can either save in capital or fiat currency.  Rate of return equality demands that both assets must provide the same return in equilibrium.  If the central bank increases inflation via faster money growth, then households optimally respond by substituting capital for fiat money.  Inflation lowers the return to fiat money so households shift their portfolio of assets away from fiat money and towards capital.  But since capital is subject to diminishing marginal returns, this lowers the rate of return on capital--or the real interest rate. Nominal interest rate thus responds less than one-for-one to rise in anticipated inflation.\n",

    "We continue to assume that capital and fiat money are both available to households, and output is produced according to $f(k)$. Recall that when discussing optimality, we are imagining a hypothetical social planner who is not subject to the frictions inherent in the decentralized marketplace, and instead can allocate resources however they like.  The only constraint is that they cannot conjure resources from nothing--*ex nihilo nihil fit*.  The planner is subject of a feasibility constraint:\n",

    "where total consumption and investment cannot exceed total output.  Aggregate consumption consists of those $N_t$ individuals born today consuming $c_{1,t}$ and $N_{t-1}$ old individuals born yesterday consuming $c_{2,t}$. Aggregate output is the endowment $y$ of each $N_t$ young born today plus the production of the $N_{t-1}$ old who accumulated $k_{t-1}$ units of capital yesterday.  Total investment is simply the amount of capital $k_t$ that $N_t$ young people choose to save today.  Notice that if we denote aggregate consumption by $C$, aggregate investment by $I$, and aggregate output by $Y$ we get a very familiar looking equation:\n",

    "The right hand side represents output net of costs of investment.  The planner finds the optimal allocation in two steps: first maximize output net of investment, then maximize welfare by choosing the distribution of consumption among the young and old based on preferences.  Maximizing output net of investment immediately obtains the optimality condition $f'(k)=n$.  Capital should be accumulated until its marginal product is precisely equal to the population growth rate.  Intuitively, this is because the marginal return on each units of investment is $f'(k)/n$, the marginal product of capital deflated by the population growth rate, while the marginal cost of each unit of investment is the forgone consumption of one unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the real interest rate is defined as $f'(k)=r$, we simply need to check whether or not the real interest rate equals the population growth rate. If $f'(k)<n$ then there capital over-accumulation, while if $f'(k)>n$ there is capital under-accumulation.  In the decentralized economy there is nothing which guarantees that $f'(k)=n$, so it is almost surely inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "What type of policies can correct this inefficiency.  First, a constant stock of fiat money prevents capital over-accumulation.  If the central bank chooses $z=1$, then the equilibrium features $f'(k)=n$ which is exactly the optimality condition.  So in this economy the optimal monetary policy is to choose a constant money supply.  Alternative policies, which we do not go into detail here include: Social security (taxing young to pay old people) reduces capital for saving and can prevent capital over-accumulation. Opposite transfer scheme (taxing old to pay young) encourages capital if there is under-accumulation\n",

    "Although we've made progress in explaining why real-world households hold both fiat money and alternative assets, there is a deeper question we've yet to contend with: in reality, fiat money has a lower rate of return than capital or private debt. Why is fiat money still valued? We will address this question more seriously when discussing banks."
