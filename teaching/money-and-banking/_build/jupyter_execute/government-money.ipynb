    "In this section, we extend the overlapping generations (OLG) model by introducing a government sector. We first assume that the government finances its spending entirely through money creation—known as seigniorage—which introduces a fundamental trade-off between generating revenue and inducing inflation. If government purchases are valued by households, there may exist an optimal level of government spending. We then consider alternative sources of government revenue, such as taxation and bond issuance, which open new channels of interaction between fiscal and monetary policy. Finally, we revisit these issues through the lens of <a href=\"https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/some-unpleasant-monetarist-arithmetic\" target=\"_blank\">Some *Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic* by Sargent and Wallace (1979).</a>\n",

    "## Introducing a Government into the OLG model\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with the simplest case in which the only source of government revenue is newly printed money, called **seigniorage**.  Government expenditures are assumed not to affect individuals' consumption choices--spending on national defense or foreign aid, for example, does not alter household's desired consumption plan.  This assumption allows us to isolate the effects of seigniorage from those of government spending itself.  Later we relax this assumption and allow government spending to directly affect agents optimal consumption plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let total real government spending be $G_t$, so that the government budget constraint is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "G_t &= M_t-M_{t-1} \\\\ \n",
    "&=\\left(1-\\frac{1}{z}\\right)\\nu_t M_t\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the right hand side is the real value of newly printed money when nominal money supply grows at constant rate $z$.  Expressed in per capita terms, where $g_t=G_t/N_t$ is government spending per person, this becomes,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g_t = \\left(1-\\frac{1}{z}\\right)q_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $q_t \\equiv \\nu_t M_t/N_t$ represents real money balances.  The key insight is that government spending is limited by the demand for real money balances. Each newly printed bill has an endogenous real value $\\nu_t$ which depends on household demand $q_t$.  If money ceases to be valued $q_t=0$, then newly printed bills are worthless to the government.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Consumer's Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Market clearing requires that the stationary rate of return on money is $\\nu_{t+1}/\\nu_t=n/z$.  The lifetime budget constraint facing a consumer is therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_{1}+\\frac{z}{n}c_2 \\leq y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the government uses new money for its own spending rather than redistributing it to households (notice the absence of the term $a$), seigniorage effectively shrinks the household’s budget set.\n",
    "\n",
    "How much spending can the government finance through seigniorage?  Are there limits or is it an infinite source of revenue? Although the government can print as many bills as it likes, their value declines as the money supply expands.  The real value of newly printed bills is $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{z}\\right)q_t$.  Although the government can print more and more bills with higher values of $z$, this inflation induces households to reduce their real money balances causing $q$ to fall.  For small inflation rates, raising $z$ can indeed increase seigniorage, but beyond some point, the decline in real balances $q_t$ dominates.   This non-monotone relationship between money creation and seigniorage revenue generates a type of <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/rwe/10.1007/978-1-4614-7883-6_280-2\" target=\"_blank\">Laffer curve</a>--a theoretical relationship between tax rates and government revenue, where government revenue rises for low levels of taxation, but eventually declines when taxes become too high.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a more general version of the decentralized equilibrium with seigniorage in <a href=\"olg-model-details.html\">this example of an OLG economy with a government sector.</a>.  In this example, we do not restrict ourselves to a constant money growth rate, but instead allow the path of money to simply satisfy the governments budgetary requirements.  Furthermore, we consider both stationary and non-stationary equilibria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal Policy under Seigniorage Financing\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the optimal fiscal and monetary policy in this case?  When seigniorage is the sole revenue source, fiscal and monetary policy coincide—-they are determined jointly by the growth rate of money supply $z$.  A central planner consider's the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\max_{c_1,c_2}&u(c_1)+\\beta u(c_2) \\\\\n",
    "&\\text{s.t.} \\quad c_1+c_2/n+g \\leq y\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The feasibility constraint simply requires that total expenditure is no larger than total output: $N_t c_{1,t}+N_{t-1}c_{2,t} + G_t \\leq N_t y$ or if we use alternative notation to denote aggregate quantities $C_t+G_t \\leq Y_t$.  Dividing this equation by $N_t$ reduces it to a per capita feasibility constraint which is precisely what is presented in the planner's problem above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution the planner's problem is straightforward.  Since government spending does not enhance welfare (it is not in the utility function), the optimal government spending is $g=0$.  This implies that $z=1$ from the government budget constraint so that there is no distortion to agents consumption/savings choice coming from inflation--no inflation, no seigniorage, and no government distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introducing Taxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an alternative source of government revenue: taxes.  Suppose that the government levies a lump-sum tax on the young, so that total real tax revenue is $T=N_t \\tau_t$.  In this case, the government budget constraint bcomes\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice something crucial: the intertemporal trade-off between present and future consumption is unaffected by a *lump-sum* tax.  It is as if a young person's income has been reduced, which has no effect on the household's Euler equation.  Said differently, the slope of the agents budget line is unaffected by a lump-sum tax.  Only inflation $z$ is relevant for distorting the agent's intertemporal trade-off.  In this case, the government can still finance its desired level of spending by using only tax revenue $g=\\tau$ and no seigniorage $z=1$.  Setting $z=1$ guarantees that the lifetime budget constraint of the household coincides with that of planner, so that for a fixed level of $g$ the optimal allocation is achieved.  Of course, if government spending is still not valued by households (not in the utility function), then it is optimal to have $g=0$.  Finally, let's consider the case where government spending is valued by households.\n",

We will allow the government to finance its expenditure by seigniorage or taxation.\n",

    "An equilibrium in the decentralized economy is given by $(c_1,c_2,g)$ computed from the Euler equation, the lifetime budget constraint, and the government budget constraint given policy variables $(\\tau, z)$.  Notice that for any $z \\neq 1$ the trade-off between present and future consumption is distorted relative to the planner.  This is clearly demonstrated by comparing the Euler equations.  Therefore, the only chance for $(c_1,c_2)=(c_1^{pp},c_2^{pp})$ is to set $z=1$.  Of course, this precludes of seigniorage revenue implying that all government spending is financed by taxes $g=\\tau$.  But notice that with $g=\\tau$ and $z=1$ the lifetime budget constraint of the household exactly coincides with that of the planner. Therefore, the decentralized economy can achieve the optimal allocation!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main lesson is that using the printing press to finance government budgets introduces a welfare cost of inflation.  If instead lump-sum taxes are used, then these intertemporal distortion does not appear.  Why not use lump-sum taxes for everything?  There are at least two problems. The first concerns equity.  In practice we care about economic inequality, and the burden of a fixed tax is heavier on the poor than the rich.  Second concerns enforcement. There needs to be appropriate bureaucratic apparatus to collect the taxes.  It is extremely easy (and essentially costless) to fire up the printing presses."

    "## Some unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "This section reviews an important paper on the relationship between fiscal and monetary policy.  <a href=\"https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/some-unpleasant-monetarist-arithmetic\" target=\"_blank\">Sargent and Wallace's (1981)</a> paper *Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic* describe a situation where monetary policy has limited control over long-run inflation.  This occurs because the government, committed to a particular path for fiscal deficits, must finance its spending through either money creation or bond issuance.  Tightening monetary policy increases teh growth of interest-bearing government debt, which eventually necessitates higher money supply growth to services the accumulated debt and interest, thereby increasing inflation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a startling conclusion given conventional wisdom at the time of the paper's publication was that monetary policy, if it could exert any influence over the economy, could control long-run inflation.  This position is most eloquently presented in 1968 by <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Milton Friedman in his presidential address to the AEA</a>.\n",
    "Friedman argued that monetary policy cannot permanently influence real output, unemployment, or real interest rates; but can exert substantial control over long-run inflation.  Sargent and Wallace show that that Friedman's dictum needs certain qualifications.  In particular, economists must explicitly describe the interaction between fiscal and monetary policies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper defines two different regimes: (i) **dominant monetary policy** or (ii) **dominant fiscal policy**.  Dominant monetary policy means that the monetary authority decides the path of base money so that the amount of seigniorage revenue supplied to the fiscal authority is pre-determined.  The fiscal authority therefore faces spending constraints imposed by the public's demand for government bonds.  In this regime, monetary policy retains control over inflation.  Dominant fiscal policy instead supposes that the fiscal authority decides its path of budget deficits, thus pre-determining the amount of revenue that must be raised through bond sales and seignorage.  The monetary authority ability to finance government spending is constrained by the demand for government bonds, and must finance the remainder with seignorage.  In this regime, it is possible that monetary policy looses control over inflation: tight monetary policy today may imply high future inflation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The environment Sargent and Wallace consider is consistent with the assumption underpinning our OLG model.
