The central bank can alter overnight nominal interest rates through open market operations in the reserves market. These short-term nominal rates influence longer-term rates via the yield curve.

    "## The Phillip's Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1958, economist A.W. Phillips published a landmark empirical paper that examined the relationship between unemployment and wage growth in the UK.  He discovered that periods of low unemployment were associated with rapid increases in wages, while periods of high unemployment corresponded to slow wage growth. Subsequent studies found similar negative relationships between unemployment and inflation in other countries. This empirical regularity became known as the *Phillip's Curve*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the Phillips Curve is straightforward. When labor markets are tight—that is, when the unemployment rate is low—firms face difficulty hiring workers and therefore raise wages to attract and retain labor. These higher wage costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, generating inflation. In contrast, when unemployment is high and labor markets are slack, wage growth slows and inflation tends to ease. During the 1960s, this apparent trade-off between unemployment and inflation was interpreted as a potential policy tool: governments could, in principle, achieve lower unemployment by tolerating somewhat higher inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in 1967, Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps identified a crucial theoretical flaw in this interpretation. They argued that firms and workers care about real wages—not nominal ones. When people expect prices to rise, they negotiate higher nominal wages in advance to maintain their purchasing power. As a result, both wages and inflation increase one-for-one with expected inflation, in addition to responding to the tightness of the labor market. Friedman and Phelps also introduced the concept of a natural rate of unemployment—the rate consistent with perfectly flexible prices and competitive markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the real wage rate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w = W/P\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W$ is a nominal wage rate and $P$ is the price level.  Or in terms of growth rates\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g_w = g_W-\\pi\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Expansionary monetary policy can temporarily raise output and lower unemployment, leading to higher nominal wage growth. But as workers and firms begin to anticipate inflation, they will increase nominal wages in line with prices to preserve real purchasing power. In the long run, the attempt to sustain unemployment below its natural rate will fail, as inflation expectations adjust upward. Each new round of expansionary policy would be met with higher inflation expectations, causing inflation to accelerate without producing lasting employment gains.  Friedman’s reasoning implied that policymakers could not permanently exploit a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Attempts to push output above potential ($\\tilde{Y}>0$) would lead only to accelerating inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Friedman and Phelps formalized this insight with the **expectations-augmented Phillips Curve**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi_t = \\pi_t^e - \\omega(U_t-U_n)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U_t$ is the actual unemployment rate, $U_n$ is the natural rate of unemployment, and $\\pi_t^e$ is expected inflation.  In the long run, expected inflation tends to equal actual inflation--because you can't continually fool the public--$(\\pi_t^e = \\pi_t)$, eliminating the tradeoff.  Nevertheless, in the short run, unexpected inflation can temporarily reduce unemployment below its natural level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in the 1970s, the apparent relationship between unemployment and inflation broke down. Periods of low unemployment were accompanied by high and persistent inflation—stagflation—rather than stable trade-offs. This empirical evidence strongly supported the Friedman–Phelps framework, and both economists later received the Nobel Prize in recognition of their contributions. Modern discussions of this concept often refer to the **Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU)**—the unemployment rate consistent with constant inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incorporating Price Shocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, inflation can also be influenced by supply-side shocks—such as changes in oil prices or import costs—that affect firms’ pricing decisions independently of the labor market. To account for this, the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve is often written as:\n",
    "\n",

    "### From Unemployment to Output\n",
    "\n",
    "We can relate inflation to output by recalling that output depends on the number of employed workers:\n",

    "Y_t = A_t K_t^{1/3}((1-u_t)L_t)^{2/3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u_t$ is the unemployment rate so $(1-u_t)L_t$ is the number of employed workers in the economy.  Expressing deviations in output relative to potential, the Phillips Curve can equivalently be written in terms of the output gap $\\tilde{Y}$.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi_t = \\pi_t^e - \\nu \\tilde{Y}_t+ \\rho\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This form of the Phillips curve highlights how inflation depends on both expected inflation and real activity. When output exceeds potential ($\\tilde{Y}>0$), inflation tends to rise; when output is below potential ($\\tilde{Y}<0$), inflation declines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaptive Expectations and Short-Run Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce interesting dynamics, we assume that agents form adaptive expectations, meaning they base forecasts of future inflation on past observations. In the simplest case, expectations are purely backward-looking:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Reality is probably somewhere in between naive expectations ($\\pi_t^e = \\pi_{t-1}$) and rational expectations ($\\pi_t^e = E[\\pi_t \\vert \\text{all information}]$).  Our models generates two extreme predictions about the dynamics of the macroeconomy so that you can think about reality being some convex combination of those two extremes.  Academic papers which try to model such a reality may assume some form of **dynamic learning** where households and businesses observe a limited set of information and make sophisticated forecasts (like an econometrician would) based on their own model of the economy. \n",

    "Modern macroeconomics builds on this framework by introducing **microfoundations**, persistence, and numerical methods. First, each component of the model—the IS curve, Phillips curve, and monetary policy rule—is derived from optimizing behavior under nominal rigidities. Second, shocks are modeled as persistent stochastic processes, such as\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing down such a model is called a **dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model (DSGE)** and is solved numerically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually you can think about combining every model we've studied so far (production function, capital accumulation, equilibrium unemployment, IS curve, Phillip's curve, monetary policy rule) introducing a 1 percent shock of your choice and numerically solving the trajectory of the economy over time.\n",

The IS–MP–PC framework helps us understand short-run dynamics and stabilization policy, the model of reserves explains how the central bank implements interest rates, and the Solow model remains essential for long-run growth analysis."
