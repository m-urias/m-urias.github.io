# International Trade

**By [Marshall Urias](https://m-urias.github.io) 🚀**

Welcome to my International Trade course site.  Included here are lectures and data tutorials presented in a Jupyter Book.  Lectures provide theoretical models related to money, assets, banking, and monetary policy.  Data tutorials are intended to show students what economic databases are publicly available, how to acquire data, and how to analyze the data using Python.  

## Course Overview

This course discusses both classical and new theories of international trade.  First, we investigate the classical models of Ricardo and Heckscher-Ohlin which introduces the concepts of comparative advantage, factor price equalization, factor content of trade, and sources of inter- and intra-national differences in income.  Second, we discuss "new" trade theories based on Krugman which identifies increasing returns to scale as alternative source of gains from trade.  We analyze a variety of such new trade theories including more recent models by Meltiz and Eaton-Kortum to bring you closer the frontier of research in international trade.  Finally, we discuss how countries borrow and lend from each other and measure the flow of funds between countries using the balance of payments accounts.  We analyze how economies are affected by global linkages to better understand the function of exchange rates, interest rates, and the current account. 

Below is a table of contents for the course content. This table of contents can also be conveniently navigated on the left hand panel.

### Classical Trade Models

- [Ricardian Model](ricardian-model.ipynb) This lecture formalizes the concept of comparative advantage in a two-country world.  Comparative advantage arises from productivity differences which generate gains from trade.  We measure the extent and distribution of gains from trade across countries, predict the pattern of specialization, and analyze the relative wage.  Finally, we introduce some empirical evidence in support of the Ricardian theory of trade.
- [Hecksher-Ohlin Model](ho-model.ipynb) We develop a theory of comparative advantage based on resource endowments.  This model allows us to the how the gain from trade are distributed *within* a country--there exist both winners and losers from trade.  In this context, we consider the impact of common trade policies on different groups within a country.  We explore empirical tests of the HO theory and address what modeling assumptions are too restrictive in the sense that they generate the famous "missing trade" puzzle.

### New Trade Theories

- [Specific Factors Model](specific-factors-model.ipynb) We explore the how the gains from trade are distributed *within* a country in the *short-run*.  Compared to the HO model, we consider an economy where some factors of production are immobile or specialized to a particular sector.
- [New Trade Theory](new-trade-theory.ipynb) We introduce an alternative source of gains from international trade: increasing returns to scale.  This model generates a *non-comparative advantage theory* of international trade. We explore both external and internal economies of scale and introduce the concepts of selection and scale effects from international trade.
- [Inter- and Intra-Industry Trade](melitz-model.ipynb) We discuss how different theories are more or less appropriate for explaining inter- versus intra-industry trade across countries.  We review the seminal model by Melitz (2001).

### International Trade Policy

- [International Trade Policy](trade-policy.ipynb) We discuss a partial equilibrium analysis of tariffs.  We show the existence of a theoretical optimal tariff and raise some practical caveats to implementing such a tariff.  We discuss empirical papers which measure the welfare cost of tariffs using a partial equilibrium approach and also discuss the "China shock" literature.
