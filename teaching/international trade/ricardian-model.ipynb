    "he Ricardian model is our first attempt to explain why countries trade with one another.  It identifies the sources of mutually beneficial trade and predicts which types of goods are exported and imported by different nations. Although remarkably simple, the model yields powerful insights that remain relevant to modern policy debates. Is foreign competition unfair when based on low wages? Is free trade beneficial only if a country is strong enough to withstand foreign competition? Does trade exploit poor nations by locking them into low-wage production? We begin to answer these questions—echoing centuries of skepticism about globalization—within the Ricardian framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after hundreds of years of trade theory, and a near universal consensus among economists about the merits of free trade, policymakers continue to denounce the import of manufactured goods from developing countries, claiming they displace domestic jobs. In the United States, for instance, the persistent trade deficit with China is often portrayed as a “bad deal,” where the U.S. allegedly loses wealth by importing more than it exports. This rhetoric resembles the neo-mercantilist arguments of the seventeenth century. England’s Treasurer, Thomas Munn (1682), once wrote: \n",

    "- Demonstrate **gains from trade** and refute common fallacies about international trade.\n",
    "- Relate empirical evidence on how productivity differences explain wage differences and trade patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "After examining the Ricardian model, we will turn to the Heckscher–Ohlin model, which deepens our understanding of who gains and who loses from trade and from trade protection policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivating Numerical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental lesson of classical trade theory is that nations—and individuals—can benefit from their differences by specializing in the activities they do relatively well. The greater the differences, the greater the potential gains.  Before formalizing the Ricardian model, consider two simple examples that illustrate this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam Smith first proposed the theory of **absolute advantage** as a direct challenge to mercantilist thinking, which viewed trade as a zero-sum game.  Consider the following table which shows the production technology for the United States and Mexico for Cloth and Wheat.\n",
    "\n",
    "| | United States | Mexico |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| **Wheat (bushels/hour)** | 6 | 1 |\n",
    "| **Cloth (yards/hour)** | 4 | 5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States can produce more wheat per hour than Mexico, while Mexico can produce more cloth per hour than the United States.  We say that the US has an **absolute advantage** in the production of wheat, and Mexico has an absolute advantage in the production of cloth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If each country specializes in producing the good for which it has an absolute advantage, then there exists a trading arrangement which is mutually beneficial.  Here is one such arrangement: the US exchanges 6 bushels of wheat for 6 yards of Mexican cloth.  If the US instead produced cloth by itself, it could only generate 4 yards of cloth with one labor hour.  By trading with Mexico, that single labor hour can be transformed into 6 yards of cloth.  The US has effectively gains 2 yards of cloth by trading instead of producing it domestically.  Equivalently, it would take 1.5 hours for the US to produce 6 units of cloth, so by trading with Mexico it effectively saves 0.5 labor hours.  Similarly, if Mexico tries to produce wheat itself it would take 6 labor hours.  Instead, Mexico uses $6/5$ labor hours to produce 6 units of cloth in order to acquire 6 units of wheat from the US.  Mexico saved $24/5$ labor hours, or equivalently gains 24 units of cloth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we assume that the exchange rate between cloth and wheat is one-to-one. There is a range of exchange rates which allow for mutually beneficial trade, and later we will show how to compute the *equilibrium* exchange rate.  For now, we simply want to demonstrate how gains from trade are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparative Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "It should not be surprising that if each country is more efficient at producing a particular good, then they can gain by specializing in that good and trading.  However, it is also the case that even if one country is more efficient at producing every good, there can still exist gains from trade.  David Ricardo offered this profound insight in his theory of **comparative advantage**-one of the most important lessons in all of the economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following production technologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | United States | Mexico |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| **Wheat (bushels/hour)** | 6 | 1 |\n",
    "| **Cloth (yards/hour)** | 4 | 2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in this example, Mexico has an absolute *disadvantage* in the production of *both* goods.  The United States is more efficient at producing both cloth and wheat.  Is it possible that the United States can gain from trade with Mexico even though it is better at producing everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following trading arrangement: the US specializes in the production of wheat and exchanges 6 bushels of wheat for 6 yards of cloth with Mexico.  If the US produced cloth itself, it would require 1.5 labor hours.  Instead, it uses only 1 labor hour to produce 6 units of wheat and then trades it to acquire 6 yards of cloth from Mexico.  The US still saves itself 0.5 labor hours!  Equivalently, we can say that the US gains 2 yards of cloth.  Mexico clearly gains because it would have taken 6 labor hours to produce wheat, but by trading with the US it only takes 3 labor hours.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we have described a trading arrangement where both countries benefit from trade even though the US is better at producing all goods.  The reason such an arrangement exists is because the US and Mexico have different *relative productivities* which measure the trade-off between producing one good versus the other.  The ratio of wheat-to-cloth production for the US is $6/4$, whereas it is $1/2$ for Mexico.  If the US wants to produce one extra unit of cloth, it must take labor away from the production of wheat.  The cost of producing one extra yard of cloth is therefore $6/4$ bushels of wheat.  By similar reasoning, the cost to Mexico of producing one more yard of cloth itself is $1/2$ bushels of wheat.  Therefore, cloth production is *relatively* more expensive in the US compared to Mexico ($6/4>1/2$).  This is why the US can save itself labor hours by specializing in wheat and exchanging wheat for cloth with Mexico.  We say that the US has a comparative advantage in wheat, and Mexico has a comparative advantage in cloth.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, there are a range of production technologies for which mutually beneficial trade can occur.  When we build our general model, we allow for any level of production efficiency to describe when a particular country has a comparative advantage.  This allows us to predict the pattern of specialization and trade.  We also compute the equilibrium exchange rate between the two countries which allows to predict the volume of trade.  With these prices and quantities determines, we can then measure the gains from trade that accrue to each nation.  One benefit of a general model is that we can alter parameters of the model (such as the efficiency of production) and investigate how the equilibrium prices, quantities, and gains from trade are affected.  This gives us insight into how economic shocks (e.g. technological progress, falling trade costs, tariff policies) affect the production, trade, and welfare of countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that our Ricardian theory of trade does not identify *why* countries have different production technologies.  One can imagine many possible reasons why the US would be better at producing wheat, for example (e.g. weather, natural resources, skilled labor, farming equipment etc.) Although it is interesting to investigate the specific reason why a country is productive at making a particular good, we don't need to know why they are productive for our theory.\n",

    "One difficulty with testing the predictions of Ricardo is that the growth of world trade and resulting specialization means that we do not get a chance to see what countries do badly---we can't measure the productivity in sectors that don't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ricardian theory of comparative advantage can explain the emergence of countries with very low overall productivity as export powerhouses in some industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bangladesh is a very poor country, with extremely low overall productivity, but it's exports of clothing was booming and catching up to China (the dominant supplier at the time)\n",
    "- Even though Bangladesh was less productive than China in every industry, its  disadvantage was much smaller in clothing\n",
