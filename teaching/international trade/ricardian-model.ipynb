    "The Ricardian model is our first attempt at explaining why countries trade with each other.  We use it to identify the source of mutually beneficial trade, and also predict which type of goods will be exported and imported by different countries.   Although a simple model, it provides some powerful insights that are still relevant in policy debates today. Is foreign competition unfair when it is based on low wages? Is free trade only beneficial if your country is strong enough to stand up to foreign competition? Does trade exploit a country and make it worse off when its workers receive much lower wages than workers in other nations?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even after hundreds of years of trade theory, and a near universal consensus among economists about the merits of free trade, policy makers continue to make speeches denouncing the growing imports of manufactured goods from developing countries, claiming they are displacing domestic workers from jobs.  Policymakers in the US, for example, cite the persistent current account deficit between the US and China as a major problem and seek to implement trade protections (e.g. tariffs) to reduce this trade imbalance. The claim is that the US is ``getting a bad deal\" and losing wealth since it is importing more than it is exporting.  This rhetoric sounds eerily similar to the neo-mercantilists hundreds of years ago.  Take Thomas Munn, England's Treasurer in 1682: *The ordinary means therefore to increase our wealth and treasure is by Foreign Trade, wherein we must ever observe this rule; to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value. For . . . that part of our stock exports which is not returned to us in wares imports must necessarily be brought home in treasure bullion...* \n",

    "- Demonstrate gains from trade and refute common fallacies about international trade\n",
    "- Describe empirical evidence that wages reflect productivity and that trade patterns reflect relative productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "After discussing the Ricardian model, we then turn to another classical model developed by Heckscher and Ohlin.  With both models in hand, we can add nuance to our arguments for and against free trade by discussing who are the winners from free trade and trade protection policies.  \n",

    "Few economists believe that the Ricardian model is a sufficient description of the causes and consequences of world trade, but it's two principles are powerful ideas that are still relevant to the real world:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Productivity differences matter for the pattern of trade\n",
    "- It is comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage that matters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One difficulty with testing the predictions of Ricardo is that the growth of world trade and resulting specialization means that we do not get a chance to see what countries do badly---we can't measure the productivity in sectors that don't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ricardian theory of comparative advantage can explain the emergence of countries with very low overall productivity as export powerhouses in some industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bangladesh is a very poor country, with extremely low overall productivity, but it's exports of clothing was booming and catching up to China (the dominant supplier at the time)\n",
    "- Even though Bangladesh was less productive than China in every industry, its  disadvantage was much smaller in clothing\n",
