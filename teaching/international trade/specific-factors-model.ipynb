    "Trade benefits the country as a whole because it certainly allows the economy to consume more than it would under autarky. In theory, it possible to redistribute income so that everyone gains from trade.  In reality redistribution is hard to implement, and so there are usually winners and loser from trade. Our short-run model of trade tells us that those who stand to lose from trade are the immobile factors in the import-competing sector.  In reality this includes not only capital, but also a portion of the labor force in those import-competing sectors. Given enough time, those workers can transition from eh import-competing sector to the export-sector, but in the short-run they are likely to suffer. For example, production workers in the apparel sector in the US in 2015 received an average wage about 30 percent lower than the average wage for all production workers. Most economists still favor free trade despite the short-run losses it can impose on import-competing sectors. It is better to allow trade and compensate those who are hurt by it than to prohibit trade. There exist ``safety net\" policies like unemployment benefits, and subsidized retraining and relocation programs that can help.\n",

    "The sugar industry in the US is very organized and was able to acquire protections against import-competition. Over the past 30 years, the average price of sugar in the US has been about twice the average price on the world market. A 2015 study by the US General Accounting Office estimated that this distorted price distortion cost \\$3.5 billion to consumers, or about \\$30 per household. The benefits of import restriction is highly concentrated in a small number of producers: seventeen sugar cane farms generate more than half of the profits for the whole sugar cane industry. Those producers are organized in trade associations that actively lobby on their members' behalf, and make large campaign donations.  Consumers, on the other hand, are generally unaware of the cost and \\$30 is not enough to incentivize them to organize. Sugar import restriction do save jobs in the sugar industry, but the cost is extremely high: over \\$3 million per job saved. Sugar import restrictions also reduce employment in other sectors that rely on large quantities of sugar in their production processes. In response to high sugar prices in the US, many candy-making firms have shifted their production sites to Canada.  On net, the sugar restrictions generate employment *losses* for US workers.\n",
