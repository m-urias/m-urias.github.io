    "The **Solow-Swan model**--often referred to simply as the *Solow model*--is a foundational framework in macroeconomics for understanding the sources of long-run economic growth. Developed independently by Robert Solow (1956) and Trevor Swan (1956), this model provides a theoretical explanation for how the accumulation of physical capital, labor force growth, and technological progress determine a country's economic trajectory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the Solow model emphasizes three forces shaping the path of an economy:\n",
    "1. Capital accumulation (the buildup of physical tools, equipment, and infrastructure),\n",
    "2. Labor force growth (an expanding workforce),\n",
    "3. Technological progress (improvements in knowledge and efficiency)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the simple production function model developed in the last chapter, the Solow model endogenizes the capital stock.  That is, we will have a theory about how capital accumulates over time which in turn drives economic growth.  With this tool in hand, we then investigate to what extent the accumulation of capital can, by itself, deliver sustained economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic growth is not uniform across countries. Over the past half century, some economies have experienced rapid, sustained increases in living standards, while others have stagnated.  This disparity is not simply a matter of different starting points; it highlights the critical importance of understanding the mechanisms that drive prosperity.\n",

    "Consider the cases of Botswana and Gabon as an example. Both countries were rich in natural resources and had similar levels of GDP per capita in the early 1960s. However, their economic paths diverged dramatically. Botswana leveraged its diamond wealth into a highly successful, stable economy. From 1965 to 2017, its GDP per capita grew at an astonishing average rate of 6.2% per year.  Gabon, despite having vast oil reserves, saw its growth stall. Over the same period, its GDP per capita grew at a much lower average rate of 1.4% per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stark contrast prompts the question: What factors account for such differences in long-term economic prosperity? While a complete answer involves complex issues like governance, institutions, and policy, the Solow model provides a crucial first step by focusing on the fundamental role of capital accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solow model provides an abstract representation of an economy's ability to produce goods and services. A useful way to conceptualize this process is through the following metaphor.  Imagine a large family farm that grows only one crop: corn.  The capital stock of this economy is represented by the farm's silo, which contains bags of corn seeds. The production process involves the farmers (the labor force) planting some of these kernels in the spring. Over the summer, the seeds grow, and in the autumn, a harvest is collected. This harvest represents the total economic output, or Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A portion of this harvest is consumed by the family to live, while the remaining portion is saved and invested—-that is, it's put back into the silo as new seeds for the next season. The size of the harvest grows year after year because the family is continuously adding more seeds to the silo. This process of re-investing a portion of the output back into production is the essence of capital accumulation in the Solow model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solow model explores whether this process of capital accumulation alone can lead to ever-increasing prosperity, or if there are inherent limitations that cause the economy's growth to slow down over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Solow model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solow model rests on a small set of relationships that capture how an economy produces, allocates, and accumulates resources over time. These relationships can be grouped into four components:\n",
    "1. A production function that describes how capital and labor combine to generate output.\n",
    "2. A resource constraint that allocates output between consumption and investment.\n",
    "3. A capital accumulation equation that links current investment to future capacity.\n",
    "4. A savings rule that determines how much of output is set aside for investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these equations describe the entire trajectory of the economy. Let’s develop them step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Production Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The economy produces final output using capital and labor according to a **production function**.  Here we continue to use the Cobb-Douglas form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_t = AK_t^{\\alpha}L_t^{1-\\alpha}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, $Y_t$ is the total output (GDP) in period t. The inputs are capital ($K_t$) and labor ($L_t$). The term $A$ represents the level of technology or total factor productivity, and the exponent $α \\in (0,1)$ represents capital's share of income. From this production function, we can see three potential drivers of economic growth: an increase in the size of the workforce ($L$), an increase in the capital stock ($K_t$) or an improvement in technology ($A$).  However, since the relevant measure for citizens' economic wellbeing is output *per capita*, increasing the size of the workforce will not deliver meaningful growth.  We are left with either accumulation of capital or technological advancement as our hope for growing prosperity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Resource Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "In our economy, output can only be used for one of two purposes: consumption ($C_t$) or investment ($I_t$). This accounting identity is captured by the **resource constraint** equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_t = I_t+C_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that consumption represents the goods and services that are used by households to satisfy their wants and needs, while investment represents the portion of output that is set aside to build new capital, such as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capital Accumulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of output invested today determines the amount of capital the economy has available to it tomorrow.  Specifically, the capital stock in the next period is equal to the capital from the current period, plus new investment, minus the capital that wears out or becomes obsolete (depreciation).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K_{t+1}=K_t+I_t-\\delta K_t\n",
    "$$ (law_motion_capital)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta$ is the depreciation rate, a parameter that represents the fraction of the capital stock that depreciates each period.  This is called the **capital accumulation equation**: it determines how much capital the economy has given investment and depreciation.  We can also express this equation in terms of the *change* in the capital stock:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta K_{t+1} = I_t-\\delta K_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which shows the change in the capital stock is the difference between investment and depreciation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling Savings and Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solow model simplifies the decision of how to allocate output by assuming that each period the economy consumes a constant fraction of output and invests the remainder.  This behavior is represented by the equations\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{s}$ is the savings rate.  Although unrealistic, the behavioral assumption allows the model to remain very simple while still delivering insight.  More complicated models, such as Real Business Cycle (RBC) models, allow households to choose how much to consume and save; but this level of complexity is outside our current scope of analysis.  Additionally, let's assume that the technology of the economy and workforce are constant over time:\n",

The growth rate will be highest when the economy is farthest from its steady state and will slow down as it approaches the steady state.

Once it reaches its steady state level, however, GDP per capita is constant at $y^*$ and consumption is constant at $c^*$. Somewhat unsatisfying (but insightful!) conclusion: capital accumulation cannot be a source of *sustained long-run growth*.  This is the most critical limitation of the basic Solow model. To address this shortcoming in the next chapter we introduce **technological progress** and **population growth**. These additions will transform the model from one of temporary growth to a steady state into a model of sustained growth driven by forces beyond simple capital accumulation."

At the steady state, investment exactly equals break-even investment, leaving $k_t$ constant over time.\n",

    "With the model in hand, we can perform some experiments to predict how our economy responds to changes in its parameters. A classic example is a change in the savings rate.  Specifically, suppose that households increase the fraction of income they save, raising the savings rate $\\bar{s}$.\n",

    "A higher savings rate increases investment, since $i_t = \\bar{s}y_t$. At the previous level of capital per effective worker $k^*$, investment now exceeds the break-even investment needed to cover depreciation, population growth, and technological progress.  As a result, capital per effective worker begins to grow.  Output rises alongside the capital stock until the economy reaches its new steady state with more capital per effective worker and higher output.\n",

We always assume $U'(C)>0$ so that more consumption generates higher welfare, and we usually assume $U''(C)<0$ so that the extra satisfaction from more consumption diminishes.

    "### Kaldor Growth Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "How do the predictions of the Solow model compare to patterns observed in the real world?  In 1963, the British economist Nicholas Kaldor made a list of six stylized facts about growth in a single (industrialized) country:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Output per capita grows over time, and its growth rate does not tend to diminish.\n",
    "2. Physical capital per worker grows over time.\n",
    "3. The rate of return to capital is nearly constant.\n",
    "4. The ratio of physical capital to output is nearly constant.\n",
    "5. The shares of labour and physical capital in national income are nearly constant.\n",
    "6. The growth rate of output per worker differs substantially across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how well the Solow model lines up with each fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact \\#1: Per capita output grows over time, and its growth rate does not tend to diminish**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steady state, output per capita $\\frac{Y}{L}$ grows at rate $g$.  Thus, the model predicts sustained growth in living standards—consistent with Kaldor’s observation. (Note that the model does not distinguish between per capita and per worker.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact \\#2: Physical capital per worker grows over time**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in the steady state, capital per worker $\\frac{K}{L}$ grows at rate $g$.  This mirrors the data: both output per worker and capital per worker tend to rise together over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact \\#3: The rate of return to capital is nearly constant**\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't talked about the rate of return to capital, so let's briefly discuss it now.  If we assume perfect competition, then the rates of returns to factors of production should be equal to their marginal products. For capital this means $ r = MPK = \\frac{\\partial F(K,AL)}{\\partial K}$.  For the case of the Cobb-Douglas production function this is $r= \\alpha \\frac{Y}{K}$. On the equilibrium trajectory of the Solow economy the rate of return to capital $r$ will be constant because $Y$ and $K$ both grow at rate $n+g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact \\#4: The ratio of physical capital to output is nearly constant**\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, because $Y$ and $K$ both grow at rate $n+g$, the ratio $K/Y$ is constant in the Solow model.  Another success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact \\#5: The shares of labour and physical capital in national income are nearly constant**\n",
    "\n",
    "The shares of income going to capital and labor are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\frac{rK}{Y}=\\alpha \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{wL}{Y}=1-\\alpha\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With Cobb–Douglas, these shares are fixed parameters, consistent with the empirical observation that labor and capital shares have been remarkably stable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fact \\#6: The growth rate of output per worker differs substantially across countries**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the model is less successful. Solow identified two sources of economic growth: capital accumulation and technological progress. This naturally leads us to two possibilities regarding how the model predictions may deviate from the data. It may be that different countries have different (possibly country-specific) technological growth rates or, even if they share the same technological growth rate, different observed growth rates could arise if countries are at different distances from their steady state. Since the model does not explain why technological progress occurs (it as exogenous), it is not clear whether the growth rate could be different across countries.\n",
