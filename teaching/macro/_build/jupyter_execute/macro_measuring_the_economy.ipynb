    "## Measuring the Size of the Economy\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important measure of economic performance is called **gross domestic product**, or **GDP**, which measures the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country over a certain period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Definition: Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\n",

    "The total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country over a period of time.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This definition contains three important ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Market value: Prices provide weights so that we can add apples, smartphones, and airplane tickets together.\n",
    "2. Final goods and services: We count only goods purchased by the final user to avoid double-counting. For example, the value of flour is not included separately if it is used to bake bread that is sold.\n",
    "3. Within a country: GDP measures production within national borders, regardless of whether the producer is foreign-owned.\n",
    "\n",
    "GDP is a broad statistic: it captures the size of the economy, allows comparisons across countries, and provides insights into living standards and economic growth.  Economists, policymakers, businesses, and journalists often refer to GDP because it helps answer key questions:\n",
    "- Is the economy expanding or contracting?\n",
    "- How does a country’s economic output compare to others?\n",
    "- Are people, on average, better off than in the past?\n",

    "- How do we separate the value contributed by a singe company from the value contributed by another when most goods involve supply chains?\n",
    "- How do we control for changes in prices (which are unrelated to the *quantity* of goods produced)?\n",

    "### Three Ways of Measuring GDP\n",
    "\n",
    "When we compare the GDPs of two countries, we presume that the country with the larger GDP produces more in some useful sense.  Suppose Country A produces 10 billion apples and Country B produces 10 billion durian.  Who produces more?  We use market prices to tell us which goods are more valuable, apples or durian. Things can get tricky when prices do not reflect market forces.  North Korea, for example, does not have market prices so assigning meaningful measure of GDP is difficult. Since every transaction has both a buyer and a seller, we can approach measuring value added from (at least) two directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Imagine a rural economy made up of only farmers and fisherman.  The farmers harvest vegetables while the fishermen catch fish.\n",
    "- How do we measure GDP for this economy?\n",
    "- How do we measure income (GNI) in this economy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Annual GDP in this economy is the total value of vegetables and fish produced during the year.  Assuming that all the vegetables and fish are sold (perhaps the fisherman buy vegetables, and the farmers buy fish), then the **value of production** must also equals the **value of expenditure**.  Furthermore, since each purchase is money in the pocket of farmers and fishermen, we also have that the annual GDP is equal to **total income** in the economy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "GDP can be viewed from three complementary perspectives:\n",
    "1. Production approach: Sum of value added across all firms.\n",
    "2. Expenditure approach: Total spending on final goods and services.\n",
    "3. Income approach: Total income earned by factors of production.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three perspectives give rise to a fundamental accounting identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{production} = \\text{expenditure} = \\text{income}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute the size of an economy by either measuring the value added market value of goods and services produced, the amount spent on goods and services, or the amount of income earned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of different types of income:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorizing Economic Output\n",
    "The most common way of categorizing expenditure is into four broad components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consumption** ($C$) is spending by households on goods and services (e.g. I buy a Xiaomi 11)\n",
    "- **Investment** ($I$) is business spending on capital goods, plus residential construction and changes in inventories (e.g. construction of a new building or purchasing a new machine)\n",
    "- **Government spending** ($G$) is both consumption and investment done by the government (e.g. defense spending)\n",

    "\n",
    "How do we control for changing prices?  We pick a year, called a **base year&&, and use the *same* set of prices to compute real GDP over time.  If we want to measure how an economy has growth between 2021 and 2022, then we pick either the 2021 prices or the 2022 prices and use it to compute real GDP in both years.  \n",

    "Chain weighting is especially useful when evaluating how an economy grows over a long period of time.  In this case, you would apply this chain-weighting procedure for each year (e.g. real GDP in 2022 is computed using prices from 2021 and 2022, real GDP in 2021 is computed using prices from 2020 and 2021 and so on).  Why is it useful?  Imagine you want to compare GDP in 1960 to GDP in 2022.  In 1960 computers were extremely expensive relative to other goods, while in 2022 they are relatively much cheaper.  Using a Laspeyres index (1960 prices) would produce very fast growth for real GDP, while the Paasche index (2022 prices) would produce much slower growth.  Chain weighting gives and average and therefore reduces the impact of extreme movements in relative prices.\n",

    "### Comparing GDP Across Countries\n",
    "Of particular interest to international economics is comparing the economic performance of different countries.  This introduces some additional difficulties...\n",

    "\n",
    "Obvious problem: the data is in different currencies!  First we need to express GDP in a common currency.  We can do so making using of an \\textbf{exchange rate}---the price at which one currency trades for another currency.  Example: The average exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the U.S. dollar in 2021 was 6.452, which means that \\$1 can buy 6.452 RMB.\n",

    "Another problem: we are not controlling for price differences between the two countries.  It's very likely that local relative prices will differ between the two countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose that food is significantly cheaper in China compared to the U.S. Even if China and the U.S. produce the same quantity of food, so that real food output is identical, there will be differences if we use local prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using market exchange rates, economists will create a hypothetical currency, called \\textbf{international dollars}, and use this as a common unit of measure.  The idea is that a given amount of international dollars should buy roughly the same amount---and quality---of goods and services in any country.  The exchange rates used to translate nominal values into international dollars are purchasing power parity conversion rates, or **PPP conversion factors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purchasing power** refers to the amount of goods and services a person can buy with their money. \n",

    "- GDP is the most widely used measure of economic performance and can be measured as production, expenditure, or income.\n",
    "- National accounting identities reveal relationships among consumption, investment, savings, and trade, but do not imply causality.\n",
    "- Real GDP adjusts for changing prices using index numbers such as Laspeyres, Paasche, and Fisher indices.\n",

    "1. In a two-good economy (fish and vegetables), compute nominal and real GDP for two years using both Laspeyres and Paasche indices. Which index overstates growth? Why?\n",
    "2. Suppose a country runs a trade deficit ($NX<0$). Use the flow of funds identity to explain what must be happening to savings and investment.\n",
    "3. Compare GDP per capita between China and the US using both market exchange rates and PPP conversion. Which measure is more appropriate for assessing living standards?\n",
    "4. Investigate the Big Mac Index for your own country. Is your currency over- or undervalued relative to the dollar?\n"
