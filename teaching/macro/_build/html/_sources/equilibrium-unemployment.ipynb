    "## The Labor Market\n",
    "\n",
    "The **labor market** refers to the process by which workers find jobs, leave jobs, and the resulting wage that firms pay.  When analyzing the labor market, there are some key questions we want to address:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How are aggregate labor market outcomes---unemployment, job vacancies, and employment---determined as equilibrium phenomena?  \n",
    "- How are wages determined?\n",
    "- What role does the labor market play in explaining business cycles and growth?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the defining features of the labor market we emphasize in this chapter is that trade in the labor market is a decentralized, uncoordinated activity that is costly for both firms and workers.  This is very different from the classical supply and demand story that characterizes other markets.  As such, we do not assume that there exists some market clearing price but rather that wages are the outcome of a negotiation between the firm and worker.  The process of finding appropriate employers and employees, negotiating wages, and/or returning to the labor market after an unsatisfactory job called **job creation** and **job destruction**.  These flows of workers finding jobs and losing jobs every month is a normal, dynamic feature of the labor market.\n",

The labor market does not clear automatically (contrary to a simple supply-and-demand analysis).\n",

For example, after Covid workers may become more picky about finding jobs that allow them to work from home with would be represented by a lower value of $A$.\n",

For simplicity, let's assume an exogenous **job separation rate** $s$.  Job separations happen because the worker-firm match is not productive forever.  We need not be specific about the reasons why the worker-firm match is no longer valuable.  Some plausible reasons are that there is a negative productivity shock or a negative demand shock which makes the firm unable to generate profits any longer. \n",

Intuitively, it's effect on the wage equation comes from workers' ability to capture a fraction $\\beta$ of the productivity gains; while it's effect on job creation comes from firms' ability to earn higher profits with more productive workers thereby incentivizing them to create more vacancies.  More vacancies increase the job finding rate and therefore reduce unemployment.  The net result from the positive productivity shock is therefore higher wages and lower unemployment.\n",

As a result, firms find it less attractive to create jobs and therefore reduce the number of vacancies.  Fewer vacancies decreases the job finding rate and thus increases unemployment.  The net result is higher wages and higher unemployment (a higher $\\beta$ produces similar results).  Note that we are gnoring any disincentive effects (i.e. in spite of higher unemployment income, the unemployed continue to seek employment with the same effort).\n",

Higher mismatch slows the speed of job creation.  The job creation curve shifts downward reflecting the increase in average hiring costs.  The wage falls as does market tightness.

    "For the U.S., the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) publishes estimates of the **natural rate of unemployment**. The natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is the rate of unemployment arising from all sources except fluctuations in aggregate demand. Estimates of potential GDP are based on the long-term natural rate. (CBO did not make explicit adjustments to the short-term natural rate for structural factors before the recent downturn.) The short-term natural rate incorporates structural factors that are temporarily boosting the natural rate beginning in 2008. The short-term natural rate is used to gauge the amount of current and projected slack in labor markets, which is a key input into CBO's projections of inflation.\"\n",
