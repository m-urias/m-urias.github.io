    "We want a simple model that can be used to explain and measure economic growth over a long period of time.  Let's begin by imagining an economy composed of a single company: a noodle shop. To cook noodles, the owner needs to employ people (\\textbf{labor}) and rent some cooking equipment (\\textbf{capital}). The more people that work at the shop, or the more equipment the shop rents, the more noodles that can be cooked and served.\n",

In this example, we could imagine productivity reflecting how skilled the workers are at cooking, or how advanced the equipment is.
