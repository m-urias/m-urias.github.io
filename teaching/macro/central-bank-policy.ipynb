    "## The Market for Reserves\n",
    "\n",
    "Central banks manipulate overnight interest rates by intervening in the market for bank reserves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks demand reserves for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regulatory requirements: Many central banks require member commercial banks to hold a certain fraction of their liabilities in the form of reserves.  This is called the **required reserve ratio**.  In China it is usually around 12\\%.\n",
    "- Payments:  Banks need to hold reserves to settle payment requests that come through the payments network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Banks must hold the required **reserve amount** stipulated by law, but will also choose to hold some **excess reserves** as insurance against unanticipated payment requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On any given day some banks will have more reserves than they want, and some banks will have less reserves than they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The interbank money markets are where banks borrow and lend reserves to each other using short-term financing arrangements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the US the interbank money market is called the **Fed Funds Market** and the equilibrium interest rate that banks charge each other for reserves is called the **Fed Funds Rate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fed funds rate (or any interbank lending rate) reflects the opportunity cost of holding excess reserves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the Fed funds rate is high, it very costly to hold excess reserves because those reserves could have been lent out to earn a high rate of return\n",
    "- When the Fed funds rate is low, it is not so costly for banks to hold excess reserves\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is a negative relationship between the total demand for bank reserves and the overnight lending rate.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Central banks have monetary policy tools which help them keep the short-term interest rate inside a target range:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discount window: Central banks can lend reserves to commercial banks and decide the interest rate to charge for these reserves.  This ``discount rate\" places a **ceiling** on the Fed funds rate since banks would never choose to borrow in the interbank market at a higher rate.\n",
    "- Interest on excess reserves: Central banks can pay interest to commercial banks on their excess reserve balances.  This places a **floor** on the Fed funds rate because banks would never lend out reserves at a rate below the interest rate they could earn by simply holding reserve balances.  The opportunity cost of holding excess reserves is gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central bank completely controls the amount of reserves in the banking system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary tool central banks use to adjust the supply of reserves is **open market operations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The central bank can sell government bonds from its balance sheet in order to remove reserves from the banking system.\n",
    "- The central bank can purchase government bonds from commercial banks in order to add reserves to the banking system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The central bank completely controls the supply of reserves and by adjusting this supply can target overnight interest rates in the market for reserves**.\n",

    "- In September 2013 the Fed began a program of taking\n",
    "in money from a wide range of non-bank financial institutions and paying interest. The technical name for this programme is the Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility (ON RRP). Now the ON RRP rate is the effective floor.\n",
    "\n",

    "The Fed says, Any counterparty that can use the ON RRP facility should be unwilling to invest funds overnight with another counterparty at a rate below the ON RRP rate, just as any depository institution eligible to earn interest on reserves should be unwilling to invest funds overnight with another counterparty at a rate below the interest rate on excess reserves. \n",

    "To summarize, there are two basic environments under which monetary policy manipulates short-term interest rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scarce reserves (China): Open market operations change the supply of reserves in the banking system thereby adjusting the equilibrium interbank interest rate.\n",
    "- Ample reserves (US post 2008): Reserves are ample so that open market operations don't move interest rates much.  Instead, administrative rates IOER and ON RRP are used to adjust the equilibrium interbank interest rate.\n",
    "\n",

    "What is the Term Structure of Interest Rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often in economic models we assume that there exists one interest rate that measures the real return to capital investments.\n",
    "- In reality, there exist many different interest rates among a class of assets that reflect differences in the **risk, liquidity, and maturity** on heterogeneous capital projects.\n",
    "- We will focus on the class of assets called bonds, and identify why bonds with the same term to maturity have different interest rates.  \n",
