    "\n",
    "Having discussed long run theories of money, inflation, interest rates, and real economic activity using our OLG model, we now wish to discuss the short run behavior of the macro economy.  First, we need to empirically distinguish short run versus long run behavior. In particular, given enough time we observe that real GDP tends to increase,\n",
