    "### Timing and Types of Consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a static three period model.  At time $t=0$, agents are born and invest their wealth in a portfolio of assets.  At time $t=1$ some agents are **impatient** and desire to use their assets to purchase consumption goods.  Other agents are **patient** and wait until time $t=2$ to liquidate their portfolio for consumption.  Agents do not know their type when born, but are impatient with probability $\\theta$ and patient with probability $1-\\theta$.  They learn which type they are at time $t=1$. This description is abstract enough to imagine that agents do not necessarily have different preferences for early or late consumption, but rather are subject to probabilistic liquidity shocks.  Some agents are hit by a liquidity shock (e.g. my car broke down and I need money to fix it), which requires them to liquidate their portfolio at time $t=1$, while other are not hit by the shock (e.g. my car is running just fine) and can wait to liquidate their portfolio until $t=2$.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Let $x$ denote the fraction of wealth invested in the risky asset, so that $(1-x)$ is invested in the safe asset.  The risky asset yields a higher payoff than the safe asset only if it is held until maturity at time $t=2$.  Otherwise, liquidating it early suffers a penalty resulting a rate of return lower than the safe asset.  In fact, $r_1/r_2$ may be interpreted as a measure of liquidity where lower $r_1/r_2$ implies less liquid asset.\n",

    "Although not explicitly included in our environment yet, it is worth noting that if investments in physical capital were illiquid, then the economy operates along a steady state that is not Pareto optimal: several projects with positive NPV are discarded.  Notice that our setup resembles the three-period OLG model developed earlier.  In that environment, capital was similar to the risky asset in that it made a rate of return $r_2=f'(k)$ if held to maturity or $r_1=0$ if liquidated earlier.  Fiat money, on the other hand, was similar to the safe asset since it paid a constant rate of return $\\nu_{t+1}/\\nu_t=n/z$ in every period.  So long as $f'(k)>n/z$ there existed an equilibrium where both assets were held, similar to the condition that $\\theta r_1+(1-\\theta)r_2 >1$ in our Dimaond-Dybvig model. The extra element is uncertainty over whether or not consumption happens when middle aged ($t=1$) or old ($t=2$).  \n",

    "### Planner's Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We now derive the optimal allocation by considering a central planner who can choose the mix of risky and safe assets to maximize expected utility of representative consumer.  There is a crucial difference between the planner and an individual consumer: **the planner does not face uncertainty over the aggregate liquidity needs**.  We assume that the liquidity shock (or type of consumer) is independent and identically distributed across agents.  Therefore, we can appeal to the law of large numbers to say that there must exist a fraction $\\theta$ of the population which will desire to consumer early and the remaining fraction $1-\\theta$ will want to consumer late.  So from the planner's perspective, it *knows for certain* how many people will desire to consume early versus late.  This idea is reflected in the **feasibility constraints** of the planner:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first constraint shows that the planner must invest enough in the safe asset to satisfy the liquidity needs of a fraction $\\theta$ of the population.  Every early type, of which there are $\\theta$ since we assume the population is of size one, receives consumption $c_1$.  And this consumption is financed from the returns of the safe asset which are $(1-x)$.  The second constraint shows that the total returns from the portfolio less what is paid out to early types can be used to finance late consumption.  In principle, the planner could liquidate some of the risky asset at time $t=1$ to finance a portion of early consumption, but this is not optimal since $r_1<1$.  The planner optimally chooses to only use the safe asset to finance early consumption.  This optimality condition is implicit in the feasibility constraints above since we do not include early liquidation of the safe asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging the second feasibility constraint gives $(1-\\theta)c_2 \\leq 1-x\\theta c_1++x(r_2-1)$.  Since the risky asset gives a higher return than the safe asset, $r_2>1$, the planner will choose $x$ ar large as feasible--up to the bound $x \\leq 1-\\theta c_1$ to maximize the right hand side.

Therefore the marginal trade-off between current and future consumption is the risky asset’s full maturity return r_2.  In contrast, the decentralized economy is subject to uncertainty from liquidity shocks so that the marginal trade-off between current and future consumption is $(r_2-1)/(r_1-1)$; where $r_1<1$ makes liquidity provision costly.  \n",

    "For example, China established its Deposit Insurance Regulation in May 2015:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Article 2**: Commercial banks, rural cooperative banks, rural credit cooperatives, and other deposit-taking banking financial institutions formed within the territory of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter collectively referred to as “institutional policyholders”) shall buy deposit insurance under this Regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Article 3**: For the purpose of this Regulation, the term “deposit insurance” means the system under which institutional policyholders pay insurance premiums to the deposit insurance fund management institution, forming a deposit insurance fund, and the deposit insurance fund management institution pays the insured deposits to depositors and take necessary measures to maintain the safety of deposits and the deposit insurance fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the government insures depositors against all losses, depositors will no longer care about their bank's exposure to risk.  Banks seeking depositors must therefore offer the highest rates of return they can find, which incentivizes them to hold a riskier portfolio of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deposit insurance will induce banks to take greater risks than they would if all the risks were borne by the shareholders and depositors of the bank---this is the **moral hazard problem** of insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When banks attract investors as shareholders, depositors are more protected than losses even when bank assets are risky.]\n",

    "If a bank suffers a sudden loss, it will be subtracted from the bank's net worth and not from deposits.  Only after net worth falls to zero will depositors lose anything.\n",

    "We already saw that ROE is positively related to leverage\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\uparrow \\frac{\\text{assets}}{\\text{bank capital}} \\rightarrow \\uparrow \\text{ROE}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so there is an incentive to boost leverage which puts more risk on depositors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank regulators impose **capital requirements** to force banks to maintain a net worth no less than some fraction of their risk-weighted assets.  Basel III is the latest international standard for bank regulations that stipulate how banks should measure their risk, and what capital is required given those risks.\n",

    "{Conclusion}\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Diamond-Dybvig model shows that banks can accomplish perfect risk-sharing by transforming illiquid assets into liquid deposits\n",
    "- This maturity mismatch on the bank balance sheet, however, can generate bank runs driven by self-fulfilling beliefs\n",
    "- Bank regulations are largely motivated by preventing such runs and engendering trust in the financial system\n",
